# Python-ChatServer
This is a python chatserver project "DaBlaqChat", request permission to use code.

This is a python chatserver using 2 clients hosted by a server, 
The following application is a Linux CLI and is capable of communicating across multiple access networks - daBlaqChat

So I built a simple basic chat server that allows users to communicate and exchange information over the internet.
